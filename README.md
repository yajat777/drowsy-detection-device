# D3-DROSINESS-DETECTION-DEVICE
Patent-filed real-time drowsiness detection system using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), implemented with Python, Streamlit, and ESP32 for low-power fatigue monitoring and alerting. It is a device which can be used on dashboard on vehicles and specifically for truck drivers at night for alerting and safety.  

💤 Drowsiness Detection System (Patent Filed)

This project presents a real-time driver drowsiness detection system that uses computer vision–based Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to monitor eye closure and detect fatigue. The system processes live video input to identify prolonged eye closure and generates alerts to help prevent fatigue-related accidents.

The solution combines Python-based computer vision, a Streamlit web interface for real-time monitoring, and a low-power ESP32 microcontroller for embedded alert triggering. The architecture is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and suitable for deployment on resource-constrained hardware.
